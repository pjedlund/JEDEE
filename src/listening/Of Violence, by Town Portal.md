## Of Violence

### by Town Portal


supported by

[Elizabeth](https://bandcamp.com/fruitcumber?from=fanthanks) different from Town Portal's prior work, but with time i have come to appreciate it just as much. hellacious, true to its name. Favorite track: Othering/Anothering.

[Alejandro Yanez](https://bandcamp.com/yanezinc?from=fanthanks) Hard to explain what I like about the beginning, I think it's the dream like / surreal-like feeling of the initial chords and the ensuing riffs which feels a bit like a spiral, a bit mesmerizing. Favorite track: Veyshnorians.

[mxyzptlk33669](https://bandcamp.com/mxyzptlk33669?from=fanthanks) This whole album is therapeutic. Actually their whole discography is therapeutic. Medicine in audio format. Favorite track: Roko's Basilisk.
